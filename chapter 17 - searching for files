the commonds: locate, find, xargs, touch, stat;

locate - find files the easy way:

locate - find files by name. the locate program performs a rapid database search of pathname, and then outputs every name that matches a given substring, such as: "locate bin/zip"

updatedb: running the updatedb program manually by becoming the superuser and running updatedb at the prompt.

find - find files the hard way: 

the find program searches a given directory (and its subdirectory) for files based on a variety of attributes.

the beauty of find is that it can be used to identify files that meet specific criteria. it does this through the application of options, tests, and actions.

tests: for example: "find ~ -type d | wc -l". find file types: "b, c, d, f, l".

operators: even with all tests that find provides, we may still need a better way to describle the logical relationships between the tests.

find logical operators: -and, -or, -not, ()

"()": note that since the parentheses characters have special meaning to the shell, they must be quoted when using them on the command line to allow them to be passed as arguments to find. Usually the backslash character is used to escape them.

predefined actions: 

haveing a list of results from our find command is useful, but what we really want to do is act on the items on the list. fortunately, "find" allow actions to be performed based on the search results.

predefined actions: -delete, -ls, -print, -quit.

remember, there is, by default, an implied "-and" relatonship between each test and action.

user-predefined actions: 

in addition to the predefined actions, we can also invoke arbitrary commands. the tradional way of doing this is with the "-exec" action. this action works like this: "-exec command {};".

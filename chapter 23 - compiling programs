what is compiling? compiling is the process of translating source code into the native language of the computer's processor.

Are all programs compiled? 

Compiling a C program: 

before we do that however, we're going to need some tools like the compiler, the linker, and "make"

Obtaining the source code: 

tar: ome projects will not create the directory, but instead will deliver the files directly into the current directory. This will make a mess in your otherwise well-organized src directory. To avoid this, use the following command to examine the contents of the tar file: "tar tzvf tarfile | head"

Examine the source tree: 

it is always a goog idea to carefully read the README and INSTALL files before attempting to build the program.

Building the program: 

most program build with a simple, two-command sequence: "./configure", "make";

configure: the configure program is a shell script which is supplied with source tree. its job is to analyze the "build" environment.

Installing the program: 

Well-packaged source code will often include a special make target called install. This target will install the final product in a system directory for use. Usually, this directory is /usr/local/bin,
